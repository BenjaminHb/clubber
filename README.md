clubber
========

#### Javascript music analysis library ####
Clubber is a library that analyzes the frequency data from an audio source and extracts the underlying rhythmic information. The processing takes the musical key into account and outputs data in a form suitable for direct use in webgl shaders, but can easily be used in any other context as well. The concept is more powerful than simple beat/peak detection and greatly accelerates the development of visualisations that sync pleasantly with the audio.

### Usage ###

### Downloads

To embed this library in your project, include this file:

* [`clubber.min.js`](http://wizgrav.github.io/clubber/dist/clubber.min.js)

For the unminified version for local development (with source maps), include this file:

* [`clubber.js`](http://wizgrav.github.io/clubber/dist/clubber.js)

### npm

First install from npm:

```sh
npm install clubber
```

And in your Browserify/Webpack modules, simply require the module:

```js
require('clubber')
```

### Instructions ###

First we instantiate a Clubber object and have it listen to an audio element. When we need to process a fresh set of samples we call Clubber.update(), usually once per render iteration.

```javascript
var clubber = new Clubber({
    size: 2048, // Samples for the fourier transform. The produced frequency bins will be 1/2 that.
    mute: false // whether the audio source should be connected to web audio context destination.
});

// Specify the audio source to analyse. Can be an audio/video element or an instance of AudioNode.
clubber.listen(audioSource); 

clubber.update(currentTime); // currentTime is optional and specified in ms.
console.log(clubber.notes); // array containing the audio energy per midi note.
```

The energy per midi note will be contained in the Clubber.notes array but the library also provides built in analysis via a mechanism called 'bands'. These are defined as ranges of midi notes and implemented as closures that, when called, will process the note energies and update a Float32Array of 4 elements. These in turn can be passed directly to webgl shaders as vec4s. The data are already usable as modulators at this stage but they can also be aggregated through time for more elaborate transitions etc. 

The produced array elements are normalized floats(0-1) and represent: 

* the strongest note (where the highest energy is) (x)
* the power weighted average of all notes (y)
* the power of the strongest note (z)
* the average energy of all notes (w)

The processing only takes into account notes which pass an adaptive threshold. You can tune that via Clubber.thresholdFactor which takes a value of 0-1. You can also tune via Clubber.smoothing which is a shortcut for the internal analyser's smoothingTimeConstant(default is 0.8 and is much more sensitive than thresholdFactor).

```javascript
// clubber here is the instantiated object from above
var band = clubber.band({
    from: 1, // minimum midi note to take into account
    to: 64 // maximum midi note, up to 160.
    smooth: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] // Exponential smoothing factors for each of the four returned values
});
clubber.update(); // This should happen first for frequency data to be current for all bands

// Calling the closure updates an object which can be Float32Array|Array|Three.Vector4|undefined
var analysedArray = band(vec4); // The internal Float32Array is also returned for convenience
```

### Tips ###

In practice one would instantiate several bands each covering a different range of midi notes, low mid high etc, calling these every render iteration and passing the returned arrays/vec4s as modulating uniforms in webgl shaders or wherever needed. 

By creatively combining the results of the analysis, the rhythmic patterns in the sound will emerge in the graphics as well. Simple combinations could be finding the min/max between adjacent band notes/energies or multiply them.

A strategy that works well would be to interpret the analysis results as vectors and operate on these. For instance map a bands strongest note on the x axis, the average note on the Y axis and calculate the length of the vector. You can go further and combine notes with powers and elements from different bands. 

And since we're dealing with vectors why not just measure distances or even dot them and see what comes out(Good stuff :) These combinations are all plausible, you can check some in the glsl demos that come with the source. You can also experiment on your own and design your modulators in the [very helpful rhythm debugger](http://wizgrav.github.io/clubber/debug).
