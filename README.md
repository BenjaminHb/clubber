clubber
========

#### Javascript rhythm analysis library ####
Clubber is a small library that analyzes the frequency data from an audio source and extracts rhythmic information. The processing takes the music key into account and outputs data in a form suitable for direct use in webgl shaders. It is a step above simple beat detection and allows for rapid creation of visualisations that sync pleasantly with the audio.

### Usage ###

Download the [library](http://wizgrav.github.io/clubber/clubber.js) and include it in your html.

```html
<script src="js/clubber.js"></script>
```

This code instantiates the library.  When we need to process a fresh set of samples we call Clubber.update(), usually once per render iteration.

```javascript
var clubber = new Clubber({
    size: 2048, // Samples for the fourier transform. The produced frequency bins will be 1/2 that.
    mute: false // whether the audio source should be connected to web audio context destination.
});
clubber.listen(audioElement); // Specify the audio player we'll analyse.
clubber.update(currentTime); // currentTime is optional and specified in ms.
console.log(clubber.notes); // array containing the audio energy per midi note.
```

The energy per midi note will be contained in the Clubber.notes array but the library also provides some built in analysis functionality via a mechanism called 'bands'. These are implemented as closures that, when called, will process the note energies and produce a Float32Array of 4 elements which can be passed directly as vec4s to webgl shaders. The processing only takes into account notes with energies above the built in adaptive threshold. The produced elements are in order: the note where the highest energy was seen, the average note for the whole band, the octave (bass vs treble) and the average energy of all triggered notes.

```javascript
// clubber here is the instantiated object from above
var band = clubber.band({
    from: 1, // minimum midi note to take into account
    to: 64 // maximum midi note, up to 160.
    smooth: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] // Exponential smoothing factors for each of the four returned values
});
clubber.update(); // This should happen first for data to be current for all bands
var analysedArray = band(); // Calling the closure updates this specific band and returns the vec4
```

In practice one would instantiate several band closures each covering a different range of midi notes, low mid high etc, call them every render iteration and pass the returned arrays/vec4s as uniforms in webgl shaders. By creatively combining the results of the analysis, the rhythmic patterns in the sound will emerge in the graphics as well. Check the demo's glsl code for reference but the creative potential is huge so I urge you to experiment and if you do make a demo and feel like sharing, drop me a note and I'll include it here for reference. That's pretty much everything concerning the library's functionality, have fun turning your favorite rhythms into color :)
